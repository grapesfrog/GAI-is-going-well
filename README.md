# GAI-is-going-well

This is a  curated collection of articles and  research  papers related to  the unexpected  or unwanted outcomes , security &amp; privacy  risks associated with using LLMs/GAI.

It’s been a never ending series of reports about the on going adverse outcomes related to the use of GAI whether deliberate attacks or just unfortunate side effects. Since I wrote the post [GAI Is Going Well](https://grumpygrace.dev/posts/gai-is-going-well/) I’ve continued to indulge in my hobby of collecting articles related to the adverse effects of working with LLMs/GAI .
There are 4 categories:

* [Adverse effects that result from deliberate attacks or just unfortunate outcomes](https://github.com/grapesfrog/GAI-is-going-well/blob/main/in-the-wild.md#in-the-wild-in-the-wild)
* [Articles on or related to  regulating AI, advisories](https://github.com/grapesfrog/GAI-is-going-well/blob/main/regulate-ai.md#regulating-ai--advisories-regulating-ai-advisories)
* [Research articles , opinions  and presentations](https://github.com/grapesfrog/GAI-is-going-well/blob/main/opinion.md#opinions--research--presentations-opinions-research--presentations)
* [Mitigations & tooling](https://github.com/grapesfrog/GAI-is-going-well/blob/main/mitigation.md#mitigations--tooling-mitigations--tooling)

Some articles are difficult to put into a single category as some research articles are exploitable in the wild.
 
 Note: Articles behind pay walls are not included. 
 
 The most recent articles are added to the top of each list.
