# GAI-is-going-well

This is a  curated collection of articles and  research  papers related to  the unexpected  or unwanted outcomes , security &amp; privacy  risks associated with using LLMs/GAI.

It’s been a never ending series of reports about the on going adverse outcomes related to the use of GAI whether deliberate attacks or just unfortunate side effects. Since I wrote the post [GAI Is Going Well](https://grumpygrace.dev/posts/gai-is-going-well/) I’ve continued to indulge in my hobby of collecting articles related to the adverse effects of working with LLMs/GAI. As time has gone on I've also started adding related articles to the opinions, research & opinions which help to provide a holistic view point.

There are 4 categories:

* [Adverse effects that result from deliberate attacks or just unfortunate outcomes](https://github.com/grapesfrog/GAI-is-going-well/blob/main/in-the-wild.md#in-the-wild-in-the-wild)
* [Articles on or related to  regulating AI, advisories](https://github.com/grapesfrog/GAI-is-going-well/blob/main/regulate-ai.md#regulating-ai--advisories-regulating-ai-advisories)
* [Research articles , opinions  and presentations](https://github.com/grapesfrog/GAI-is-going-well/blob/main/opinion.md#opinions--research--presentations-opinions-research--presentations)
* [Mitigations & tooling](https://github.com/grapesfrog/GAI-is-going-well/blob/main/mitigation.md#mitigations--tooling-mitigations--tooling)

Some articles are difficult to put into a single category as they cross the boundaries of opinions/research into being exploitable in the wild .

There are a lot of "research" papers included in the research articles ,opinions & presentation section that are published on The [arXiv papers site](https://arxiv.org/). However the site can occasionaly come across as  a glorified blog site masquerading as a place to publish scientific research papers. Peer reviews are not a key acceptance factor  and ArXiv themselves don't peer review  anyway! The focus from authors is  more about getting something out there. So don't take what you see in the list as provable/repeatable. Just because it looks sciency doesn't mean it's anything more than someone or multiple  people sat in a room just typing away sharing their thoughts, which is absolutely fine as I do that a lot too it's what makes blogging fun. That caveat aside there are absolutely  some brilliant well researched papers with repos &  evidence to back it up. Most are thought provoking and definitely worth reading even if a little dubious. Just remember that they are published as preprints so no peer reviews at this stage and some may get removed when they are subsequently peer reviewed and found lacking in rigour. I personally give more credence to the preprint papers that have repos & some proof points and so should you. However many don't  but what they're discussing is worth a glance at the very least. So I do list papers of various credibility but it's for you dear reader to actually read those papers and make your own mind up.

Note: Articles behind paywalls and those that require you to sign up to read for "free" are not generally included. Some articles are included that may only be accessible as part of a free allocation for the month.

Note August 8th 2025:  With original content creators battling AI as you will know if you read the monthly updates , it's becoming increasingly difficult to share content that isn't behind a paywall or requires you to subscribe . I read or at least scan everything I share but equally I don't want to sign up to a bazillion  more newsletters that fill up my mail box . So I will miss stories that I would normally have shared due to this continuing enshitification of the internet!
