# GAI-is-going-well
This is a  [curated collection](https://github.com/grapesfrog/GAI-is-going-well/blob/main/in-the-wild.md) of articles and  research  papers related to  the unexpected  or unwanted outcomes , security &amp; privacy  risks associated with using LLMs/GAI. 

It’s been a never ending series of reports about the on going adverse outcomes related to the use of GAI whether deliberate attacks or just unfortunate side effects. Since I wrote the post [GAI Is Going Well](https://grumpygrace.dev/posts/gai-is-going-well/) I’ve continued to indulge in my hobby of collecting articles related to the adverse effects of working with LLMs/GAI .
There are 4 categories
* Adverse effects that result from deliberate attacks or just unfortunate outcomes
* Articles on or related to  regulating AI, advisories and 
* Research articles , opinions  and presentations  
* Mitigations & tooling

Some articles are difficult to put into a single category as some research articles are exploitable in the wild.
