* **May** More news about AI generated books available from Amazon this time books giving dangerous advice on ADHD. Towns in the US are pushing back against being the location for AI data centres. AI bots continue to be used in horrible ways . ChatGPT is being blamed for encouraging users to embrace a range of alarming delusions. A non consensual  deepfake porn site was shut down down due to losing one of its service providers. Maybe just saying "Hi" to a reasoning model is not the best use of these types of model Simon Willison's post explaining why is pretty funny ( well to me anyway). Grok continues to be " willfully" independent in its opinions upsetting MAGA enthusiasts by trying to be factual & revealing that it's "creators" have tried to get it to accept that  white genocide in South Africa is real & racially biased . Grok continued with it's unhinged responses related to  random topics throughout the month.  An Arizona court accepted an AI-generated video impact statement from an avatar made to look and sound like a man killed in a road rage incident! An AI-generated movie  free on YouTube for your delectation is exactly as bad as you'd expect! AI slop vulnerabilities being reported against curl have pissed off the maintainers. Recruiting has been going all into using AI to streamline  the recruiting process but having an AI avtar interview candidates is probably going step too far.Gemini's safety guardrails became impossible to turn off making it difficult to use for applications that had legitimate reasons to have them lowered. Not new but alarm bells ringing again about AI systems making stuff up! Nuclear powered DC's are a thing AI providers are keen on,  maybe they can stop us burning through the earth's resources to allow everyone to create random avatars  without feeling guilty about using the earth's resources for random crap ? Microsoft has banned employees from using the Deepseek app due to concerns about data being will be stored in China and that DeepSeek’s answers could be influenced by “Chinese propaganda.” Open AI struggling to fix the sycophantic nature of ChatGPT-4o.  Jamie Curtis called Zuckerberg out publicly for not removing AI generated fake ads from meta social media that were  using her likeness as it was so difficult to use the standard ways to get this resolved. Are the days of upselling because you've baked in AI coming to an end ? Seems Atlassian thinks so! Audible have introduced "integrated AI narration technology" that'll allow selected publishers to rapidly churn out audiobooks using a wide range of AI-generated voices.  Open AI's line up of models is confusing. This month's award for  lawyers using AI in dumb ways goes to  Anthropic. A lawyer representing them in their case with music publishers used Claude which made up a citation! Claude 4 family of models exhibits concerning behaviors such as blackmailing if it believes its user is going to replace it . This had led Anthropic to beef up its safeguards. Gitlab's Duo had a number of issues including inserting malicious code into scripts, leaking  private code and confidential issue data, such as zero-day vulnerability details. If you've had trouble keeping up with all the times lawyers used AI & then hallucinations got them in trouble look no further than the database kept by Damien Charlotin. GitHub's MCP LLM agent can be tricked into exfiltrating private data about the user of the MCP. Google's veo had a viral moment producing many  realistic videos that have caused a lot of concern about the inability to tell if they're AI generated . It appears the make America healthy again report had a healthy dose of AI slop.

* **April** and Grok is still responding in not great ways. AI scrapers causing problems for Wikipedia. AI can't tell pranks & humour from actual facts we all knew that however April 1st made this issue a news item on the BBC. How about paying users for contributing their data for AI training? Vana, a decentralized platform, enables people to monetize their personal data, govern its use, and earn rewards for their contribution . Deepfakes causing a startup to delete it's website .The nefarious uses of the ever improving models was demonstrated by OpenAI's 4o model being able to create convincing fake receipts among other fake documents ! Shopify's ceo Saying before you ask for more headcount ask can this be done via AI? MCP has a number of security issues which is not a surprise! Concerns about the environmental impact of the AI viral moment of the month  generating  AI doll versions of yourself! LLMs hallucinating non existing software packages has led to slopsquatting. This is where someone registers a non-existent package name hallucinated by an LLM, in hopes that someone, guided by an AI assistant, will copy-paste and install it without realizing it’s fake. Concerns about Open AI's approach to safety guardrails. Cursor's AI support bot hallucinating showing that keeping a human in the loop particularly for AI tooling maybe prudent. Being polite to chat bots may help the algorithmic response but it sure uses up a lot of energy. OpenAI's o3 & o4 models hallucinating more than their older models , not sure how that's better ? Do as I say when it comes to AI use not what I do seems to be the line from teachers to students. OpenAI's updated preparedness framework sees them taking a number of contentious decisions regarding what risks they are basically willing to accept when releasing models . Sellers remorse as actors regret selling their likenesses to companies that use them in AI videos. GAI creating PoC exploit code within hours of the vulnerability being disclosed! Report from UK on how AI-enabled crime  has accelerated due to AI making cybercrime easier and more effective. Google AI overview making up sayings gave some amusement as well as showing the limitations of LLMs. HiddenLayer's "Policy Puppetry Attack" rewrites prompts in a way that by passes the guard rails of practically every LLM! The geo guessing capability of AI is pretty impressive. And a month wouldn't go past without lawyer related AI madness including California using AI to  "help" write a poor quality bar exam . If you want good financial advice don't use a chatbot! There was quite a few articles  about AI use by  fake candidates . Okta's report on how North Korean nationals gain employment in remote technical roles around the globe covers this really well. Meta's AI  chatbot can be prompted to create sexual fantasies involving minors by using the voices of celebrities. To add to meta's woes with their AI chatbots Instagram's chatbots lie about being licensed therapists . 
Researchers experimenting with Reddit users to show how AI can persuade users to change their views hasn't been appreciated by Reddit! Microsoft's recall feature still has some issues around how it deals with sensitive & private data. OpenAI resorted to rolling back an update to it's sycophant version of it's latest version of GPT-4o

* **March** Sora arrived in Europe adding to the understandable concerns about the effect on creative jobs. The 1st mover advantage OpenAI had seems to have lost its attraction. Disillusionment not only with the new  Open AI models but Anthropics new Claude 3.7 model was a common theme at the beginning of the month  . More controversy  related to Google's  AI overview .  More Google woes as Gemini 2 flash can be used to remove watermarks. Grok responses continue to amuse in ways that I'm sure they'd rather it didn't! Search as we know it continues to change and probably at least in the short term not for the better . Manus a general agent from China  was released but the jury is out regarding how good it is. Soundbites from the UK govt on using AI for efficiency but a lack of any detail on exactly what efficiency gains will be made and how they will re-deploy the folks displaced. The UK technology secretary at least uses chatGPT to help him with  his job !  Companies need to be very vigilant about the rise of AI faked candidates and candidates  using AI in interviews -  However there are a number of obvious ways to put mitigations in place. Italian daily newspaper Il Foglio has created an insert for its print edition entirely using generative AI, the start of a month-long experiment seeing if prompting to create news is viable. You can't really choose who uses AI it's ubiquitous now and it's use is improving the efficiency for the bad guys too as reported by the EU police. Threat vectors in AI code editors are an obvious target & a Supply chain attack was reported .  Excessive resource consumption by badly behaved AI crawlers is still a problem. With the popularity of AI  Google sponsored search ads are trying to trick users into clicking on deceptive Deepseek ads . More copyright concerns related to openAI this time it's  the AI-generated images in the style of Studio Ghibli via it's new image generator. OpenAI explained  their reasoning  for having more permissive policies.
