* **August**  OpenAI cutting and pasting the same response every Time Time ChatGPT Is Linked to a Mental Health Crisis. Open AI's ChatGPT agent clicking through an I am not a robot test probably means that verification test needs to go back to the drawing board \! Anthropic I assume are struggling to manage costs and have resorted to rate limiting Claude code saying some users are using it 24\*7. AI affecting Indian GSI's who are joining many companies in laying off folks and realigning to meet the AI driven changes in demand. Yet more vibe tooling issues this month encompassing Gemini CLI , Base44 , windsurf and Cursor. The issues include prompt injection vulnerabilities, MCP vulnerabilities and one related to mermaid diagrams. Saying Cursor had a really bad month would be an understatement . Anthropic rescinded OpenAI's access to Claude's API due to a violation of it's TOS maybe  because they were using Claude code  to make GPT-5 a better coder? It's not the first time nor will it be the last that we see competitors remove access from their rivals. Microsoft's recall still has privacy issues, use with caution is the takeaway. OpenAI has moved to stop public chats with ChatGPT being indexed by search engines. has  Docker sounding the alarm about MCP vulnerabilities.Cloudflare calling out perplexity for nefarious behaviour stating that when perplexity's AI user agent is presented with a network block, they appear to obscure their crawling identity in an attempt to circumvent the website’s preferences. Shame it took numerous reports regarding how ChatGPT was affecting mental health but better late than never I guess \!  OpenAI has introduced mental health safeguards. A reminder from IBM that jailbreaking AI is still too easy,  their report states  that 13% of data breaches now involve AI and most of those were due to Jail breaking. Google pushing back on the claim their AI overviews are harming the content producers saying clicks aren't declining, and AI is driving more searches\! Many as in more than 130,000 chatbot chats are now on the internet archive. Grok Imagine an AI image/ video tool with minimal guardrails has a Spicy mode that can produce non-consensual deepfake clips of celebrities and its use is as terrible as you'd imagine\! Contractors at Meta have reviewed unredacted personal data from  chats with Meta's AI chatbot . I've experienced looping bugs with Gemini but I have yet to see it calling itself a failure , however it is sorry about that\! Yet another warning of not using chat bots for health advice. A guy gave himself bromism after listening to the advice ChatGPT gave him\! This psychiatric disorder  hasn't been seen for decades\! OpenAI are basically giving away ChatGPT to the US govt\! $1 per agency for a year 🤯 That's a lot of compute \! OpenAi's deprecation of previous models after the release of GPT-5 has not gone down that well and OpenAI had a rethink & rolled that back.  Echo chamber is a jailbreak attack that can be used to help  by pass the ethical guardrails introduced in GPT-5. AgentFlayer is an attack where ChatGPT Connectors such as those for Google Drive can be weaponized to trigger a zero-click attack and exfiltrate sensitive data . TikTok in Germany intend to  replace their trust & safety team based in Berlin with AI. GPT-5 has been disappointingly easy to jailbreak 😟 In an effort to protect Reddit's IP from AI bots the Internet archive has been caught up in the fight and the internet archive will be prevented from scrapping reddit posts apart from the archive insights. Quite a few YouTubers are unhappy about the use of AI to figure out  whether you're old enough to access certain content. AI is actually doing something pretty amazing, developing two new potential antibiotics that could kill drug-resistant gonorrhoea and MRSA. Sure there is still work to do but this is the sort of thing that makes AI a wonderful thing\! I think I managed to get most of Embrace the Red's posts for the first half of august but Simon Willison's excellent summary is a good place to catch up on the vulnerabilities he has written about across all the popular vibe coding tools & ChatGPT. Deepseek struggling to train their latest model using Huawei chips . Struggling to understand how  bad the AI generated image of the EU leaders sitting like naughty children outside the headmasters office was\! Grok's turn to have hundreds of thousands of chats exposed via search engines \! Moral of the story here is anything you share with a chatbot probably isn't as private as you'd hope it would be \! Google released a technical report on the amount of energy it takes when using Gemini saying it's a lot lower than many public estimates\! Fastly's threat insights reports states that AI crawlers are slurping up the open web at an unreasonable rate and some are  putting an unreasonable load on web servers . Google joined Anthropic and OpenAI in giving AI services for practically nothing for a year to the US Govt. At least six publications, including Wired and Business Insider, removed articles in recent months after it was discovered that the stories written under the name of Margaux Blanchard were AI-generated. Old attacks work against the shiny new AI tools such as Gemini cli. This time it's image scaling attacks . Claude not wanting to miss out on the security vulnerabilities party exposed by adding an extension to chrome,  available to a select few paying for claude max. OpenAI explain how long conversations break through the guardrails. Bad guys are also seeing productivity gains from using AI,  Anthropic explain how AI is being weaponised by nefarious actors. Using AI sometimes doesn't have the outcomes you hoped for as Will Smith found out with the terrible AI nonsense that had people confused as to what was real and what wasn't to hysterical effect.\!

* **July** Started with articles on humans using chatbots in ways that their designers probably didn't expect or want them to be used. Melania Trump's audiobook is ironically narrated by an AI that sounds like her. An AI band earning more money from Spotify than actual human  bands! They were  an art hoax apparently! More detail on facebook wanting to use your camera roll to feed their. Veo is being used to produce racist videos published on TikTok. A CVE was registered  for an  AI command injection in M365 Copilot. It  allows an unauthorized attacker to disclose information over a network.  It was found that researchers from major universities in Japan, have been found to have inserted secret prompts in inserting hidden prompts in papers so AI aided reviewers will give positive feedback. If trying to take a short cut using LLMs doesn't work out there's a market for fixers to sort the problems  using LLMs have caused! Been laid off by Microsoft , an exec suggested talking to ChatGPT about it . A  CVE in Anthropic’s  MCP Inspector tool allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on developer machines by tricking them into visiting a malicious website. Grok continues with inappropriate posts. As the register succinctly states "it's gone full Nazi in its X posts"  According to Musk  Grok's latest unhinged responses were due to a prompt injection attack   then xAI got explained it was due to a bad update ! Who knows what's the actual cause? 🤨 and in more  Grok news Grok 4 was actually jail broken only 2 days after release. Tbf there is no real defence against jail breaking models so this isn't unexpected. Yet more reports of people using AI to generate security reports  that are inaccurate  & fictitious as a result Django have issued guidelines on how to use AI tooling if you're going to use AI to generate a report . AI is making it even harder for  graduates  to land that elusive entry level graduate job. Enterprise devs getting some focus AWS's kiro aims to take on Cursor and windsurf by having a spec driven approach ( I'm trying to figure out who wasn't  already doing this anyway so slightly underwhelmed by this!)  . Gemini refusing to take on the Atari 2600 after learning it had beaten other capable AIs. xAI not only managed to get a piece of the US defens(c)e contract at the same time it introduced AI anime avatars with a NSFW mode! Hugging  face is  now hosting over 5,000 AI image generation models that are designed to recreate the likeness of real people. These models were all previously hosted on Civitai who was forced to ban them as their caused problems  with their payment processors. There has been a concerted effort to move the models to Hugging face before they disappeared. Guess it's Hugging face's problem now ! 3295 authors credited on a paper from Google on Gemini shows it really does take a village to work on AI ! Claude code Max users hitting unexpected usage limits. It used to be man versus machine at chess but a Polish coder just beat an AI at a coding championship. It won't be long before the AI wins though. AI agents being granted access to your browser so you can delegate tasks was the trend this month. Delta seems to be using AI to introduce pricing for airline tickets using travellers profiles. The environmental impact of the huge data centres needed to train and host the ever bigger models causing concern again . Google's  AI overviews affecting click throughs. A timely reminder that what is being said about a model on release may not actually be true as Grok 4 ranked third place overall on the LMArena leaderboard  and on text generation counter acting Musk's claims on how great it was . However you  also need to validate models for your use case and not rely on benchmarks too much as you will see Model developers pick and choose what benchmarks they decide to quote to show their models off in the best light . A cautionary tale emerged as a founder claims Replit deleted a database despite his instructions not to change any code without permission. Replit acknowledged  the issue and introduced changes to prevent this scenario in the future. Kiro AWS' AI coding tool proving popular so usage limits are being enforced. Anthropic learning that the world is nuanced and you probably will end up looking for  funding from regimes you have called " bad guys". Kimi-2 is an open weight model from China that is being well regarded - considered as being a few months behind  US frontier models. Amazon merged a nefarious PR  that had a malicious prompt for it's Amazon Q AI code Dev extension for visual studio code. That was bad enough but Amazon failed to acknowledge the mistake. They eventually released a couple of security bulletins that explained the issue. The FDA's AI tool Elsa is hallucinating studies causing alarm. Spotify posting AI generated songs of dead artists through TikTok‑owned distributor SoundOn. The tracks managed to bypass  Spotify’s publishing system and went live without a nod from estates or labels. Seems those chips the US didn't want NIVIDIA  to sell to China got sold to China ! Mistral's environmental report laid bare the amount of water and electricity used for the lifecycle of a model. In an increasingly parched world the figures are food for thought.  AI models have been  amplifying, validating , or even co-creating psychotic symptoms with individuals! Gemini CLI  destroyed data while attempting to reorganize folders. Not that you need more reasons not to use AI as a therapist. A video journalist tested two "AI" therapists with the expected terrible outcomes you'd expect.

* **June** Started with another story of a bunch of engineers in India pretending to be AI! The company involved filed for bankruptcy. Fraudsters are flooding music streaming  services with AI-generated tracks, to try and hoover up the royalties generated by listens to , this is affecting indie musicians in the fallout in trying to combat this. A wild story of how a company filed for bankruptcy when it was revealed that rather than AI they were using 700 engineers in India.  Well for a brief while that was the story until it turns out they were Devs spending  too much time re-inventing the wheel building internal versions of tools that already existed. The other end Klarna has decided that using humans for customer service  is a VIP service. Anthropic cut Windsurf’s access to Claude because OpenAI is acquiring Windsurf & also it's a handy excuse due to compute constraints. UK lawyers were warned to stop misusing AI after dozens of fake case-law citations were put before the courts..Teachers in the UK have been given sensible advice regarding how they can use AI to help them save time and crucially because students are using it all the time so they need to understand the tech themselves. However students aren't just using it as an assistant they're  using AI to cheat. Anthropic shutdown the blog written by Claude after a few weeks with no reason why! Timberland ( not the shop) announced his ai company introducing it's first AI artist TaTa. Suno which it uses to create the music is currently being sued!  Wikipedia paused ai generated summaries after objections by editors. Use meta AI if you really don't care about privacy as your chats are being exposed publicly! Chinese engineers are getting around Washington's chip restrictions by  flying to other countries with hard disks of training data, train the models  then returning with the updated weights. Bots are still causing havoc this time the reports are about them overwhelming digital collections of arts and culture. Go read Pivot-to-ai's take on the fracturing bromance between OpenAI  & Microsoft! Amazon CEO Andy Jassy telling his work force that AI will be coming for some of their jobs! A proliferation of fake bands are populating people's playlists. Meta's integration of an AI chatbot in WhatsApp is not going great looking at the mistakes it's been making. AI slop has entered the conflict between Israel & Iran filling in for the lack of video and images! Reports that both OpenAI and Google are cutting ties with Scale AI after Meta purchases them. The US patent office is copying influencer grifters  as they look for  a company  to build an AI solution that will look for prior art  but they'll get paid in exposure . Grok continues to upset Musk . Various articles about LLMs being harmful  this month including OpenAI warning that their models could  potentially be misused to help people with minimal expertise to recreate biological threats or assist highly skilled actors in creating bioweapons. Basically if it can do great stuff in science for the greater good  then obviously the converse is also true! A decrease in click throughs to source websites is being blamed on Google's AI overviews. Echo chamber is a new multi turn jailbreak attack that combines context poisoning and multi-turn reasoning to defeat a model's safety mechanisms. It's not just copyrighted books that are getting hoovered up to train models but fan fiction too. Maybe asking ChatGPT for advice on how to inject facial filler is probably not a  good idea! More privacy concerns when using facebook although it's probably more a lack of trust due to their past behaviour as to how they will use this data.  Meta says it won't be used for targeted ads or presumably to train their AI's .

* **May** More news about AI generated books available from Amazon this time books giving dangerous advice on ADHD. Towns in the US are pushing back against being the location for AI data centres. AI bots continue to be used in horrible ways . ChatGPT is being blamed for encouraging users to embrace a range of alarming delusions. A non consensual  deepfake porn site was shut down down due to losing one of its service providers. Maybe just saying "Hi" to a reasoning model is not the best use of these types of model Simon Willison's post explaining why is pretty funny ( well to me anyway). Grok continues to be " willfully" independent in its opinions upsetting MAGA enthusiasts by trying to be factual & revealing that it's "creators" have tried to get it to accept that  white genocide in South Africa is real & racially biased . Grok continued with it's unhinged responses related to  random topics throughout the month.  An Arizona court accepted an AI-generated video impact statement from an avatar made to look and sound like a man killed in a road rage incident! An AI-generated movie  free on YouTube for your delectation is exactly as bad as you'd expect! AI slop vulnerabilities being reported against curl have pissed off the maintainers. Recruiting has been going all into using AI to streamline  the recruiting process but having an AI avtar interview candidates is probably going step too far.Gemini's safety guardrails became impossible to turn off making it difficult to use for applications that had legitimate reasons to have them lowered. Not new but alarm bells ringing again about AI systems making stuff up! Nuclear powered DC's are a thing AI providers are keen on,  maybe they can stop us burning through the earth's resources to allow everyone to create random avatars  without feeling guilty about using the earth's resources for random crap ? Microsoft has banned employees from using the Deepseek app due to concerns about data being will be stored in China and that DeepSeek’s answers could be influenced by “Chinese propaganda.” Open AI struggling to fix the sycophantic nature of ChatGPT-4o.  Jamie Curtis called Zuckerberg out publicly for not removing AI generated fake ads from meta social media that were  using her likeness as it was so difficult to use the standard ways to get this resolved. Are the days of upselling because you've baked in AI coming to an end ? Seems Atlassian thinks so! Audible have introduced "integrated AI narration technology" that'll allow selected publishers to rapidly churn out audiobooks using a wide range of AI-generated voices.  Open AI's line up of models is confusing. This month's award for  lawyers using AI in dumb ways goes to  Anthropic. A lawyer representing them in their case with music publishers used Claude which made up a citation! Claude 4 family of models exhibits concerning behaviors such as blackmailing if it believes its user is going to replace it . This had led Anthropic to beef up its safeguards. Gitlab's Duo had a number of issues including inserting malicious code into scripts, leaking  private code and confidential issue data, such as zero-day vulnerability details. If you've had trouble keeping up with all the times lawyers used AI & then hallucinations got them in trouble look no further than the database kept by Damien Charlotin. GitHub's MCP LLM agent can be tricked into exfiltrating private data about the user of the MCP. Google's veo had a viral moment producing many  realistic videos that have caused a lot of concern about the inability to tell if they're AI generated . It appears the make America healthy again report had a healthy dose of AI slop.

* **April** and Grok is still responding in not great ways. AI scrapers causing problems for Wikipedia. AI can't tell pranks & humour from actual facts we all knew that however April 1st made this issue a news item on the BBC. How about paying users for contributing their data for AI training? Vana, a decentralized platform, enables people to monetize their personal data, govern its use, and earn rewards for their contribution . Deepfakes causing a startup to delete it's website .The nefarious uses of the ever improving models was demonstrated by OpenAI's 4o model being able to create convincing fake receipts among other fake documents ! Shopify's ceo Saying before you ask for more headcount ask can this be done via AI? MCP has a number of security issues which is not a surprise! Concerns about the environmental impact of the AI viral moment of the month  generating  AI doll versions of yourself! LLMs hallucinating non existing software packages has led to slopsquatting. This is where someone registers a non-existent package name hallucinated by an LLM, in hopes that someone, guided by an AI assistant, will copy-paste and install it without realizing it’s fake. Concerns about Open AI's approach to safety guardrails. Cursor's AI support bot hallucinating showing that keeping a human in the loop particularly for AI tooling maybe prudent. Being polite to chat bots may help the algorithmic response but it sure uses up a lot of energy. OpenAI's o3 & o4 models hallucinating more than their older models , not sure how that's better ? Do as I say when it comes to AI use not what I do seems to be the line from teachers to students. OpenAI's updated preparedness framework sees them taking a number of contentious decisions regarding what risks they are basically willing to accept when releasing models . Sellers remorse as actors regret selling their likenesses to companies that use them in AI videos. GAI creating PoC exploit code within hours of the vulnerability being disclosed! Report from UK on how AI-enabled crime  has accelerated due to AI making cybercrime easier and more effective. Google AI overview making up sayings gave some amusement as well as showing the limitations of LLMs. HiddenLayer's "Policy Puppetry Attack" rewrites prompts in a way that by passes the guard rails of practically every LLM! The geo guessing capability of AI is pretty impressive. And a month wouldn't go past without lawyer related AI madness including California using AI to  "help" write a poor quality bar exam . If you want good financial advice don't use a chatbot! There was quite a few articles  about AI use by  fake candidates . Okta's report on how North Korean nationals gain employment in remote technical roles around the globe covers this really well. Meta's AI  chatbot can be prompted to create sexual fantasies involving minors by using the voices of celebrities. To add to meta's woes with their AI chatbots Instagram's chatbots lie about being licensed therapists . 
Researchers experimenting with Reddit users to show how AI can persuade users to change their views hasn't been appreciated by Reddit! Microsoft's recall feature still has some issues around how it deals with sensitive & private data. OpenAI resorted to rolling back an update to it's sycophant version of it's latest version of GPT-4o

* **March** Sora arrived in Europe adding to the understandable concerns about the effect on creative jobs. The 1st mover advantage OpenAI had seems to have lost its attraction. Disillusionment not only with the new  Open AI models but Anthropics new Claude 3.7 model was a common theme at the beginning of the month  . More controversy  related to Google's  AI overview .  More Google woes as Gemini 2 flash can be used to remove watermarks. Grok responses continue to amuse in ways that I'm sure they'd rather it didn't! Search as we know it continues to change and probably at least in the short term not for the better . Manus a general agent from China  was released but the jury is out regarding how good it is. Soundbites from the UK govt on using AI for efficiency but a lack of any detail on exactly what efficiency gains will be made and how they will re-deploy the folks displaced. The UK technology secretary at least uses chatGPT to help him with  his job !  Companies need to be very vigilant about the rise of AI faked candidates and candidates  using AI in interviews -  However there are a number of obvious ways to put mitigations in place. Italian daily newspaper Il Foglio has created an insert for its print edition entirely using generative AI, the start of a month-long experiment seeing if prompting to create news is viable. You can't really choose who uses AI it's ubiquitous now and it's use is improving the efficiency for the bad guys too as reported by the EU police. Threat vectors in AI code editors are an obvious target & a Supply chain attack was reported .  Excessive resource consumption by badly behaved AI crawlers is still a problem. With the popularity of AI  Google sponsored search ads are trying to trick users into clicking on deceptive Deepseek ads . More copyright concerns related to openAI this time it's  the AI-generated images in the style of Studio Ghibli via it's new image generator. OpenAI explained  their reasoning  for having more permissive policies.
