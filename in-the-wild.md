* **March** Sora arrived in Europe adding to the understandable concerns about the effect on creative jobs. The 1st mover advantage OpenAI had seems to have lost its attraction. Disillusionment not only with the new  Open AI models but Anthropics new Claude 3.7 model was a common theme at the beginning of the month  . More controversy  related to Google's  AI overview .  More Google woes as Gemini 2 flash can be used to remove watermarks. Grok responses continue to amuse in ways that I'm sure they'd rather it didn't! Search as we know it continues to change and probably at least in the short term not for the better . Manus a general agent from China  was released but the jury is out regarding how good it is. Soundbites from the UK govt on using AI for efficiency but a lack of any detail on exactly what efficiency gains will be made and how they will re-deploy the folks displaced. The UK technology secretary at least uses chatGPT to help him with  his job !  Companies need to be very vigilant about the rise of AI faked candidates and candidates  using AI in interviews -  However there are a number of obvious ways to put mitigations in place. Italian daily newspaper Il Foglio has created an insert for its print edition entirely using generative AI, the start of a month-long experiment seeing if prompting to create news is viable. You can't really choose who uses AI it's ubiquitous now and it's use is improving the efficiency for the bad guys too as reported by the EU police. Threat vectors in AI code editors are an obvious target & a Supply chain attack was reported .  Excessive resource consumption by badly behaved AI crawlers is still a problem. With the popularity of AI  Google sponsored search ads are trying to trick users into clicking on deceptive Deepseek ads . More copyright concerns related to openAI this time it's  the AI-generated images in the style of Studio Ghibli via it's new image generator. OpenAI explained  their reasoning  for having more permissive policies.
