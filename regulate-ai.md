* **September** 48 states have enacted laws addressing deepfakes, imposing jail time and penalties. China  mandates  visible labels and implicit metadata identifiers for AI-generated text, images, audio, video, and other synthetic content. Ted Cruz introduced legislation to create a regulation ‚Äúsandbox‚Äù that  would allow companies to apply for modifications to or waivers from any ‚Äúobstructive regulations‚Äù to the testing and deployment of products or services that use or contain ‚Äúin whole or in part‚Äù at least one AI system\! Anthropic's 2.5 bazillion settlement re using copyrighted works without permission was put on hold . A US publisher ( owner of Rolling Stone) is taking action against Google for its AI overviews  stating it is misusing its journalism to fuel AI Overviews . Deaths being attributed to the use of Charbots continued to be a concerning topic. More ü¶áüí©with chatbots this time a chatbot site depicting Child abuse images\!

* **August** Google may have said they will sign the EU AI code of practice but they did point out they think it's a bad idea & will stifle Europe‚Äôs development and deployment of AI. A report states that  The introduction of novel regulatory burdens runs counter to its ambition for the EU to be a center of excellence for AI and cloud computing, this time the argument is about EU efficiency proposals. A bit of a theme emerging about the EU over regulating and thus  stifling their AI ambitions. There are no Chinese AI providers signed up to  the EU AI code of practice while most of the prominent US providers sans Meta have. Mistral has also signed up. One of the strictest regulations in the US banning deepfakes during elections was struck down by a federal judge after X ( Twitter that was ) objected. Nvidia  pushing back against an accusation from the Chinese government said there are no backdoors or kill switches in its chips. While they did that they also said please don't try and make us do that and urged policymakers to reject proposals for backdoors and kill switches. Illinois has signed a bill into law known as the Wellness and Oversight for Psychological Resources Act, the law prohibits AI systems from delivering therapeutic treatment or making clinical decisions. The UK is planning 109 new DCs with no real plan on how to power them without driving up the cost of people's energy bills. Meta is being investigated after leaked documents apparently show that its chatbot was allowed to have "sensual" conversations with children\! Character AI & Meta are also in the cross hairs for  misleading children with AI-powered mental health tools ‚Äúdisguised as therapy. NVIDIA stating they do not have kill switches and backdoors  and explains why these are bad ideas. Hot debates about whether AI will ever become sentient and some states pre-empting that by legislating to ensure AI won't ever get rights\! Anthropic settled a class action lawsuit over its use of pirated copyrighted books . OpenAI is being sued by parents of a teen who took his own life alleging ChatGPT encouraged him to do so.

* **July** plenty of debate in the Senate around the AI regulation moratorium which was ultimately removed from the big beautiful bill (BBBill). EU companies including Mistral push back against the pending  EU AI act,  saying it harms the EU's competitiveness. The EU commission  however said they will not pause on the timeline to implement. A reminder that the ongoing law related AI nonsense is never ending.This time a trial judge issued an order based on fake cases luckily the appellate court put a stop to that. This is also a reminder that these lawyer AI mishaps are being tracked at the AI hallucination cases database. Payment processors are forcing AI companies that were  primarily used to generate non consensual AI porn to stop hosting those models. An EU report states that the argument that the use of copyrighted training data is defensible under "fair use," similar to a student using a copyrighted book to acquire knowledge does not stand up. Over 3/4's of the S&P 500 have added AI related risks to their official risk exposure reports . The EU reacted to criticism about the EU AI act  saying you need to comply with something without providing guidance on how you can do that so they released guidance & a template on how to comply . Meta says it won't sign up to the EU's AI code of practice . Competitors hit out at xAI not publishing any safety data after Grok's recent unhinged behaviour. Despite Meta's recent "wins" re copyright infringements , Anthriopic is now facing a class action lawsuit representing all U.S. writers whose work was allegedly downloaded from libraries of pirated works. The BBBill may have had the clause that  effectively would have  banned  AI regulation  removed  but Trump is doubling down by essentially re introducing as part of his AI action plan with something very similar but  a more vague, provision buried within it . Oh and while he's at it he's also attacking "woke" AI . A bill was introduced that would protect copyrighted content from being used for AI training without the owner's permission.

* **June** The UK is still struggling to figure out how to deal with copyright protections . Reddit is suing Anthropic for using their data without ponying up for that access. OpenAI is continuing to have  legal woes after being forced to  preserve all ChatGPT user logs. The neuron has an excellent write up of this. A complaint has been submitted to the Federal Trade Commission urging regulators to investigate Character.AI and Meta‚Äôs ‚Äúunlicensed practice of medicine facilitated by their  therapy-themed chat bots . NY passed the RAISE bill to compel developers of large foundation models ( so the big players)  to publish thorough safety and security reports on their frontier AI models. Rumours are a plenty about how the bromance between OpenAI and Microsoft is breaking up for real this time apparently! Perplexity have upset the Beeb( BBC) who asked them to stop using BBC content to train models ( horse has bolted there I feel!) The US creeps closer to the decade long ban on state-level AI regulations. A  judge ruled that Anthropic  training its AI models on legally purchased  physical books without authors‚Äô permission is fair use and "exceedingly transformative" , however he also said that the company must face a separate trial for pirating ‚Äúmillions‚Äù of books from the internet for its library of material. Meta also had a win however with this warning from the judge " This ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta‚Äôs use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful," and It stands only for the proposition that these plaintiffs made the wrong arguments and failed to develop a record in support of the right one" Techdirts analysis is a reasonable explanation of how despite "wins" in both cases there are  opposite conclusions from the judges and this thus leaves the AI copyright issue as unresolved as it ever was . In an effort to protect against deepfakes the Danish government is going to  changing copyright law to ensure that everybody has the right to their own body, facial features and voice

* **May** Seems the UK govt are rethinking their preference for an opt out model for the use of copyrighted material for training AI. OpenAI will remain under the control of its not-for-profit board, while becoming a public benefit corporation. Have to admit I'm not entirely sure what that means in practice! UK creatives continue to apply pressure to update copyright laws in a way that protects them from artificial intelligence using their work without their consent. In the meantime  the US fired the head of the U.S. copyright Office after the office  issued the 3rd part of a long report on AI which questioned the use of copyrighted righted material by AI.  The Budget Reconciliation Bill would  effectively ban AI regulation, on the federal *and *state levels. The UK is still struggling to figure out how to protect ( or not) copyrighted works from being sucked up to train AI. The UK technology secretary is being seen as not neutral enough in his dealings with big tech. A Judge ordered OpenAI to keep all output logs from ChatGPT even those chats users have requested be "deleted ". The EU has eased some of the rules and requirements to support Europe‚Äôs competitiveness in AI.

* **April** The Tony Blair institute rebooting copyright report is doubling down on the opt out approach & seems slanted to supporting companies developing LLMs rather than supporting the human creators of the original data needed to train them. The UK govt is still struggling with  AI copyright; both Open AI & Google provided a response. Open AI allegedly still using copyrighted books this time from  O'Reilly without permission despite no changes to the law as yet! The inability to really tackle  Deepfakes was in the news. Meta's efforts to grow in China by sharing AI info raised eyebrows. Open AI  countersued Musk for harassment but a group of ex open AI employees decided to support Musk by filing a proposed amicus brief in support of his lawsuit opposing OpenAI‚Äôs planned conversion from a nonprofit to a for-profit corporation. EU investigating X for using EU's users data for training Grok while not adhering to GDPR. The EU has approved meta using user's data to train AI. Meta saying all those copyrighted books it slurped up to train it's models are worthless seems a bit disingenuous to say the least!  UK licensing  bodies have proposed a s collective licence that will allow authors to be paid for the use of their works to train generative AI models. Ziff Davies also suing OpenAI for copyright infringement. Alarm bells raised about  subpoenas sent to Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and 10 other tech companies last month by the House Judiciary Committee about  past efforts to ‚Äúadvance equity‚Äù in AI development and curb the production of ‚Äúharmful and biased outputs‚Äù are a target of investigation, according to subpoenas sent to Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and 10 other tech companies last month by the House Judiciary Committee.

* **March** AI disclosure in movies was top of mind at the beginning of the month because of the oscars. Pinterest changed their TOS so it can use user  data whenever it was posted to train AI. A freedom of information request revealed what the UK technology secretary has been asking chatGPT! OpenAI trying to get  some Chinese models specifically cough cough Deepseek banned in the US causing the world's smallest violin to be played.  Google & OpenAI both basically advocating to train on copyrighted works without the inconvenience of negotiating with copyright holders creatives are very unhappy.  The Atlantic compiled a search engine that could trawl the LibGen files ( pirate site of books) to uncover which books, exactly, were scraped by Meta to train their AI . Hugging Face proposed their own AI policy  suggestions . Creatives continue to be adversely affected by AI displacing them. Cursor refusing to complete a coding task saying it  refused as it would complete the "vibe " prompter's work for them. China has announced that all AI generated material must be labelled. I'm thinking perhaps nefarious actors are unlikely to comply ! Character.ai was in the news again due to two lawsuits dragging Google into it due to their investments in it.  Hallucinations via chatbots damaging people's reputation with false information popped up again. Apple has been sued due to Apple intelligence not being that intelligent yet! Spain approved a bill to  impose huge fines on companies that use AI generated content without labelling it. Be interesting to see how they can enforce this as AI slop is everywhere and it's getting harder every day to distinguish from non AI generated content it adopts the bill guidelines from the EU AI Act imposing strict transparency obligations on AI systems.

* Feb and Deepseek was still an area of concern with countries investigating it and banning the app. A US senator's approach to dealing with  Chinese AI advances was interesting to say the least . There were concerns with the statement from the Paris AI action summit, the US & UK did not sign the agreement. More stating the obvious that bad guys could misuse AI by Eric Schmidt  this time( By the way they already are!).  A copyright win also snuck in among the continuing arguments regarding what can be slurped up without recompense to the original creators. A loophole in the EU AI Act was also causing concern regarding copyright. The relaxation of approaches to AI safety was also in the news.  The growing discontent about creatives losing out to BigTech was in the news and in the UK has resulted in a silent album ( yes I paid for a copy before you ask) as a protest at the Govt wanting to essentially make it easier to use copyrighted work with many huge names speaking out!
