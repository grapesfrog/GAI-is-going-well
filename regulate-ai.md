* **March** AI disclosure in movies was top of mind at the beginning of the month because of the oscars. Pinterest changed their TOS so it can use user  data whenever it was posted to train AI. A freedom of information request revealed what the UK technology secretary has been asking chatGPT! OpenAI trying to get  some Chinese models specifically cough cough Deepseek banned in the US causing the world's smallest violin to be played.  Google & OpenAI both basically advocating to train on copyrighted works without the inconvenience of negotiating with copyright holders creatives are very unhappy.  The Atlantic compiled a search engine that could trawl the LibGen files ( pirate site of books) to uncover which books, exactly, were scraped by Meta to train their AI . Hugging Face proposed their own AI policy  suggestions . Creatives continue to be adversely affected by AI displacing them. Cursor refusing to complete a coding task saying it  refused as it would complete the "vibe " prompter's work for them. China has announced that all AI generated material must be labelled. I'm thinking perhaps nefarious actors are unlikely to comply ! Character.ai was in the news again due to two lawsuits dragging Google into it due to their investments in it.  Hallucinations via chatbots damaging people's reputation with false information popped up again. Apple has been sued due to Apple intelligence not being that intelligent yet! Spain approved a bill to  impose huge fines on companies that use AI generated content without labelling it. Be interesting to see how they can enforce this as AI slop is everywhere and it's getting harder every day to distinguish from non AI generated content it adopts the bill guidelines from the EU AI Act imposing strict transparency obligations on AI systems.

* Feb and Deepseek was still an area of concern with countries investigating it and banning the app. A US senator's approach to dealing with  Chinese AI advances was interesting to say the least . There were concerns with the statement from the Paris AI action summit, the US & UK did not sign the agreement. More stating the obvious that bad guys could misuse AI by Eric Schmidt  this time( By the way they already are!).  A copyright win also snuck in among the continuing arguments regarding what can be slurped up without recompense to the original creators. A loophole in the EU AI Act was also causing concern regarding copyright. The relaxation of approaches to AI safety was also in the news.  The growing discontent about creatives losing out to BigTech was in the news and in the UK has resulted in a silent album ( yes I paid for a copy before you ask) as a protest at the Govt wanting to essentially make it easier to use copyrighted work with many huge names speaking out!
