* Feb and Deepseek was still an area of concern with countries investigating it and banning the app. A US senator's approach to dealing with  Chinese AI advances was interesting to say the least . There were concerns with the statement from the Paris AI action summit, the US & UK did not sign the agreement. More stating the obvious that bad guys could misuse AI by Eric Schmidt  this time( By the way they already are!).  A copyright win also snuck in among the continuing arguments regarding what can be slurped up without recompense to the original creators. A loophole in the EU AI Act was also causing concern regarding copyright. The relaxation of approaches to AI safety was also in the news.  The growing discontent about creatives losing out to BigTech was in the news and in the UK has resulted in a silent album ( yes I paid for a copy before you ask) as a protest at the Govt wanting to essentially make it easier to use copyrighted work with many huge names speaking out!
